# LeetCode Solutions Portfolio

Welcome to my personal collection of LeetCode problem solutions! This repository is a record of the coding challenges I’ve solved on LeetCode, along with their solutions, explanations, and test cases. It serves both as a **portfolio** to showcase my problem-solving skills and as a learning resource for others.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- **Showcase my LeetCode solutions**: A collection of the problems I've solved, demonstrating my approach and thought process.
- **Serve as a portfolio**: A public record of my growth as a problem solver.
- **Encourage learning and improvement**: Embracing solutions from others and allowing for corrections, feedback, and improvements.

## Repo Structure

Each problem is organized in its own folder. Inside, you’ll find:

- **`solution.ts`**: The TypeScript solution to the problem.
- **`solution.test.ts`**: Unit tests to verify the correctness of the solution, written using Jest.
- **`README.md`**: A brief description of the problem and any relevant details.
- **`solution.md`**: A detailed explanation of the solution, including:
  - **Approach**: The strategy or algorithm used.
  - **Intuition**: My thought process in tackling the problem.
  - **Time Complexity**: Analysis of the solution’s time complexity.
  - **Space Complexity**: Analysis of the space complexity.

Additionally, you'll find links to the **LeetCode problem page** in each problem's README for easy reference.

## Contributing

I encourage contributions! If you have a different approach to a problem, or suggestions for improvement, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request.

- **Corrections**: If you spot any mistakes or inefficiencies in the solutions, please submit a correction.
- **Improvement suggestions**: I’m open to suggestions on optimizing the solutions further.

## Setup

To fork or clone this repository and set it up locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ridwanade16/codechallenges.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run tests**:
   To run the tests using Jest:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

4. **Generate new problem folders**:
   You can generate a new problem folder using the script provided in the `scripts` directory:
   ```bash
   ts-node scripts/generate.ts <problem-number> <problem-title>
   ```

   This will create a new folder with the problem’s solution template, test cases, and documentation.

## Links to LeetCode Problems

For each solution, I’ve included a link to the original problem on LeetCode. You can find these links in the problem’s `README.md` file, so you can directly visit the problem page on LeetCode for more context and discussion.
